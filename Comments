Formulas 
w=Velocity/radius
RPM= w/(0.10472)

Calculate of the torque of the motors 
1oz-in=0.007061Nm
84oz-in= 0.5931 Max torque

Max velocity 
500 RPM
In radians per seconds = 52.35 

Measured step = Max range - Min range / 2^bits -1
solving for bits = 10 bits

angle (aperture)
30Â°= 0.523 radians


Teacher you should press the flor in order to use the keyboard control and it is not turning for the max torque if you want to see it turning you should change the max torque.
